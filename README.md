# ESP8266-Ikea-Skarsta-Trotten-Web-Dashboard
![arduino build workflow](https://github.com/flosommerfeld/ESP8266-Ikea-Skarsta-WebDashboard/actions/workflows/build-arduino-sketches.yml/badge.svg)

Web Dashboard for controlling a Ikea Skarsta/Trotten table which comes from the factory with manual height adjustment.

The hardware selection and 3D models of this project are mainly based on the [Instructable](https://www.instructables.com/Motorizing-an-IKEA-SKARSTA-Table/) of user pashiran. In comparison this project uses a website ("web dashboard") for controlling the table height. There are no hardware switches, just the website which can be accessed via the hosted ESP8266 server (which shall be in the same network as your clients).

## 3D Model
As previously mentioned, the [3D models](#credits) of user pashiran were used in this project.
Small holes were drilled into the table in order to screwing the `Body1.stl` with M3 screws to it. After installing `Body1.stl`, the  `Body3.stl` (case) was screwed on to it.  Some M3 insert nuts were installed to `Body1.stl` with a soldering iron.

Body1.stl ([Download](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/FHK/3039/KJWV4CPV/FHK3039KJWV4CPV.stl)) | Body3.stl ([Download](https://content.instructables.com/ORIG/F6Q/4HMT/KJWV4CPX/F6Q4HMTKJWV4CPX.stl))

## Finite State Machine
The implementation is based on the following FSM:

## Dependencies
Used dependencies for this project are:
- [Arduino Library for Cytron Motor Drivers](https://github.com/CytronTechnologies/CytronMotorDriver), used to control the motor
- [HCSR04 ultrasonic sensor Library for Arduino](https://github.com/gamegine/HCSR04-ultrasonic-sensor-lib), used to read the distance from the ultrasonic sensor

The dependencies can be installed via the [standard procedure for installing Arduino libraries](https://docs.arduino.cc/software/ide-v1/tutorials/installing-libraries):

1. Open the Arduino IDE, select `Sketch` -> `Include Library` -> `Manage Libraries...`.
2. Search for `Cytron Motor Drivers Library`/`HCSR04 ultrasonic sensor Library`.
3. Click `Install` to install the library.
4. Restart the Arduino IDE.
